//
// `lodge_pipeline` attempts to model the graphics pipeline as a single object.
// 
// A pipeline can be created from a desc struct, and then applied
// (`lodge_pipeline_push`) to fully configure the draw state, and then
// withdrawn (`lodge_pipeline_pop`) to return to the previous state.
//
// A local cache compares the state changes before calling into the underlying
// graphics API.
//
// NOTE(TS): The strategy to implementing this in a sane manner is to add
// features as needed, rather than to strive for completeness.
